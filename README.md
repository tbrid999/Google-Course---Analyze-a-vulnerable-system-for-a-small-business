Purpose Section
Why conduct the vulnerability analysis? The database server is crucial for business operations as it stores valuable customer information and supports employees working remotely. Securing this data is essential to maintain the trust of customers and employees and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. If the server were disabled or compromised, critical business functions could be disrupted, leading to financial losses and reputational damage. This assessment aims to identify vulnerabilities and recommend measures to safeguard the system.

Risk Assessment Section
Table Example (Adapt to the template provided):

Threat Source	Threat Event	Likelihood	Severity	Risk Score
Cybercriminals	Data exfiltration	3	3	9
Insider threat (disgruntled employee)	Unauthorized access to data	2	3	6
Hacktivists	Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)	3	2	6
Approach Section
Reasoning for Identified Risks The selected threats were chosen based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Cybercriminals frequently target exposed databases to steal sensitive information, which could lead to data breaches and financial loss. Insider threats are significant as they exploit legitimate access to compromise systems or data. Lastly, hacktivists often launch DDoS attacks to disrupt operations, impacting the availability of critical services. These risks pose severe challenges to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

Remediation Section
Strategies to Mitigate Risks To address these risks, implement the following security controls:

Enforce the principle of least privilege to restrict database access to only authorized personnel.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance access security.
Use a firewall and intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) to prevent unauthorized access and detect suspicious activity.
Apply encryption protocols to protect data both in transit and at rest.
Regularly update and patch the system to reduce vulnerabilities.
